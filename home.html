                A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for athletics. The word is derived from the
                ancient Greek term "gymnasium".[1] They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and as
                activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre",
                which is often an area for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air areas as
                well. In Western countries, "gyms" (or pl: gymnasia") often describe places with indoor or outdoor
                courts for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for
                physical development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries, Gymnasium (and variations
                of the word) also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a
                university, with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.
